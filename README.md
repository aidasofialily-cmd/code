# C++ Game Project

A simple C++ project for game programming.

## How to Build and Run

This project uses a `Makefile` for building and running the game.

### Build the game
To compile the source code, run the following command:
```bash
make
```
This will create an executable file named `game`.

### Run the game
To run the game, use the following command:
```bash
make run
```
Alternatively, you can run the executable directly:
```bash
./game
```

### Clean up
To remove the compiled files, run:
```bash
make clean
```
