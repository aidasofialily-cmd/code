## 2024-05-22 - DX as UX in a CLI Environment

**Learning:** In a developer-facing project with no graphical user interface (GUI), the Developer Experience (DX) *is* the User Experience (UX). A clean, well-documented, and easy-to-use build process is the equivalent of an intuitive UI for a developer. First impressions matter, and a project that's hard to get running creates a poor initial experience.

**Action:** I will apply UX principles to the DX by improving documentation, adding a clear build process, and establishing a logical project structure. This will make the project more welcoming and accessible to new developers.
