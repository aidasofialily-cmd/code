## 2024-06-11 - Adapting to a No-UI Environment

**Learning:** When a project has no graphical user interface, UX principles can still be applied to the *developer experience*. A clear and easy-to-use project structure, build process, and documentation are crucial for a developer's productivity and satisfaction.

**Action:** In the future, for any project without a GUI, I will focus on improving the "developer UX" by:
- Ensuring the `README.md` is a comprehensive and welcoming guide.
- Creating a simple, intuitive build process (e.g., a `Makefile`).
- Providing a basic "Hello, World!" example to demonstrate that the project is set up correctly.
- Ensuring the `.gitignore` is set up to prevent build artifacts from being checked in.
